### Review Questions
11.1 List and briefly define three techniques for performing I/O.
11.2 What is the difference between logical I/O and device I/O?
11.3 What is the difference between block-oriented devices and stream-oriented devices?
11.4 Why would you expect improved performance using a double buffer rather than a
single buffer for I/O?
11.5 What delay elements are involved in a disk read or write?
11.7 Briefly describe RAID levels 0,1,2,3,5,6 in a big picture sense (e.g. raid 1 is mirroring, raid 2 needs x number of extra disks, etc.)
